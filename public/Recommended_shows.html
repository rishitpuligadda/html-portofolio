<h1>Micky's Favourite Shows:</h1>
<h2></h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The great pretender</h3>
<p>The animation at the beginning might seem different to others but once you get used to it, The show is really interesting and has many twists which are just unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>Got hoked up to it when one of my friend has recommended this to me and I would really want everyone to experience that feeling which i had while watching this show.</p>
<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>This was the very first anime which I have watched and It's probably my favourite anime till date.</p>
<h3>Intersellar</h3>
<p>Just watch it already!</p>
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>The show revolves around a couple and the movie made me view relationships in a different way, there will always be things which wouldn't go we intend them to go but not fixing them together would make people to go seperate ways.</p>
